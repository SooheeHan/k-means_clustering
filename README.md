Implementation of Parallelized k-Means Clustering Algorithm for Unsupervised Classficiation of Large Satellite Images

Programs for k-means clustering algorithm:

main_sequential.cpp: a sequential program which does not use parallel processing
main_intra.cpp: a parallel program which runs on multiple cores in a PC's CPU using OpenMP
main_hybrid.cpp: a parallel program which runs on a PC cluster which comprizes a master node and several slave nodes using OpenMP and MPI
